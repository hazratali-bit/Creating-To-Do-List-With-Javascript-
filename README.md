This is a to do list. i have created with css and vanilla javasript(js6). The project do use the local storage of the 
browser to store the data so that when the user add some information and then refresh the window then the program have to 
load information from the local storage of the browser. 

you can make it better if you are internted.

Functionalities:

1. you can add element to the list very easily.
2. you can remove the element from the list.
3. The data is stored locally and whenever the user come bach the data will be there.
